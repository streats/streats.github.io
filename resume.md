Content professional focused on information design, user experience and accessibility. Having worked in startups, multinationals as well as public sector organizations, I know how to design for a variety of environments and users, and have experience with both high-level content strategy and hands-on content delivery. 

## Professional Experience

### Senior Content Designer, GitHub
#### June 2022 to March 2024
I worked on making sure documentation met user needs and was scalable, discoverable and accessible. This involved managing discovery efforts, identifying and closing content strategy gaps, and bringing user-centered design practices to how we planned, created and maintained documentation for GitHub's products. I also contributed to GitHub accessibility's community and culture by advising Hubbers on accessible content and writing accessibility guidance for internal and external audiences.

##### Specific accomplishments
* Produced content standards for the GitHub Docs style guide on using tables, footnotes and icons, with specific consideration for accessibility.
* Developed update to content strategy for use of callouts in documentation, with a specific goal to provide clearer guidance for Docs contributors and minimise "banner blindness" for users.
* Conducted content review of GitHub Actions documentation set, including content inventory, information architecture mapping, and research with users.

#### October 2020 to May 2022
I designed technical guidance for technologists in government, with a focus on APIs and technical standards compliance. I produced content that met GOV.UK style and accessibility standards.

##### Specific accomplishments
* Produced guidance on creating and sharing spreadsheets, which included researching spreadsheet accessibility best practice through desk research and consulting with accessibility subject matter experts.
* Conducted content mapping exercise to understand how data-related guidance was connected across GOV.UK, identify gaps in discoverability and improve experience.
* Collaborated with user researchers and multidisciplinary designers to improve data-related guidance in the government Service Manual through user research, content design and content testing.
