<h1>Thirst Trap</h1>
<p>Thirst Trap is a personal project I'm working on with my partner Jearold and some friends. It's a mobile video game. </p>

<p>This page contains some experiements as I learn how to use interactive story software Twine, as a way to create basic text-based prototypes for our game. </p>

<p>More to be added soon.</p>
