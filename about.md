Hi, I’m Annie. I solve design problems through content and content systems.

I’m driven by making information and services fairer and more accessible to everyday people, through better technology, better language, and better interactions.

I consider myself an information designer. Whether I'm writing UX copy, developing content standards, or collaborating with designers and engineers, I work by combining content strategy and systems design to approach projects using first principles.

I'm based in Philadelphia, PA since April 2024. Prior to this I spent 7 years in London, UK and 8 years in Dublin, Ireland.
