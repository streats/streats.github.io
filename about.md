Hi, I’m Annie. I create digital experiences through content and content systems.

I’m driven by making information and services fairer and more accessible to everyday people, through better technology, better language, and better interactions. While wearing many hats during my career leading product and design at startups, I developed experience in UX design, content strategy, and research. I am now focused on applying my varied product, customer, and creative skillset to UX- and content-focused projects. 

Non-professionally, I spend a lot of time thinking, reading, and writing about sustainability and ethics (particularly in the areas of fashion and food), video games, accessibility, and education. I enjoy teaching and mentoring and like to use all parts of my professional and personal experience to encourage curiosity and creativity.
