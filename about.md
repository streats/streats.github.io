Hi, I’m Annie. I solve design problems through content and content systems.

I’m driven by making information and services fairer and more accessible to everyday people, through better technology, better language, and better interactions.

While wearing many hats during my career leading product and design at startups, I developed expertise in UX design, content strategy, and research. I've worked in regulated industries (financial services, healthcare) as well as government, education, and cloud services.

I consider myself an information designer. Whether I'm writing UX copy, developing content standards, or collaborating with designers and engineers, I work by combining content strategy and systems design to approach projects using first principles.

I'm based in Philadelphia, PA since April 2024. Prior to this I spent 7 years in London, UK and 8 years in Dublin, Ireland.
