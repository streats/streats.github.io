This is a challenge obviously here in our home, but also all over the state. It's clear that this weather event is so extreme almost behind imagination. This is the time when the whole community really needs to pull together and you're out of here and just a moment how the city is expanding shelters and providing additional services are being covered here in a second but I just want to tell everybody that we need, we need your help to. When you get ready to conserve and you'll hear about that to stay warm.
