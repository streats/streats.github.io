Okay everybody we're on take it away.<br><br>

0:22<br>
All right, thank you everyone for joining our joint city of Austin Travis County press conference to discuss the severe weather and the impact it's had on our residents. With this press conference we're joined by Travis County Judge Andy Brown. City of Austin Mayor Steve Adler city of Austin City Manager Spencer Kronk and city of Austin, Office of Homeland Security Emergency Management Director, Juan Ortiz. We are also joined by Austin energy General Manager, Jacqueline Sargent. We are also joined by our poll reporter from Fox seven who will be asking questions after our opening statements. With that, I would like to hand it off to Travis County Judge Andy Brown, for some comments.<br><br>

1:09<br>
I think we lost Andy man. Actually, it looks like we've lost the judge so I will go ahead and hand it off to city of Boston Mayor Steve Adler. All right.<br><br>

1:24<br>
MAYOR STEVE ADLER<br>
Hi. It is cold outside and icy outside and that's not news to [inaudible] . We have I understand now over 2 million people in the state of Texas that are currently without power. This is a challenge obviously here in our home, but also all over the state. It's clear that this weather event is so extreme almost beyond imagination. This is the time when the whole community really needs to pull together and come together. You're gonna hear in just a moment how the city is expanding shelters and providing additional services. That'll be covered here in a second but I just want to tell everybody that we need, we need your help too. We need everybody to conserve, and you'll hear about that, to stay warm. We also need folks to take and help the neighbours. Call neighbours that surround you, that you [know] or who might be in need. Call your family members, make sure everybody's doing okay. There are also some community organisations that are reaching out that in addition to what you'll hear that the city and the county are doing. Please step into the support that. Diane and I are supporting several, one of which is the Austin area Urban League, they've launched, launched an emergency donation drive, called the Love Thy Neighbour TX campaign. That's Love Thy Neighbour TX campaign. They accept monetary donations, they're putting together a hotel voucher effort, which certainly would be useful to many of our neighbours this evening. The website is AAUL.org which is the Austin Area Urban League .org Organisers have established safe methods to be able to accept monetary donations from the, from the community. This is one of those things that happens once in several generations. That's really is going to require resolve to pull together and help one another. To that end, I think that, we'll hear from some of the government folks sitting down to talk about what's happening there.<br><br>

3:58<br>
HOST<br>
It looks like we have the Travis County Judge back online so judge I'll hand it back off to you so you can get your comments in. <br><br>

4:07<br>
JUDGE<br>
Thank you so much. So, Yeah, like so many of you I've actually been.<br><br>

4:24<br>
HOST<br>
It looks like the judge is still having some technical issues. So with that I will hand it off to Austin City Manager for some comments.<br><br>

4:39<br>
AUSTIN CITY MANAGER<br>
Thank you. And as the mayor said this has truly been an unprecedented event and I want to start by thanking all the employees and first responders who are working tirelessly, to keep our operations running and helping our community through as we get through this extreme weather event. As a city we are doing our best to help those in the greatest need. We have received numerous offers to help, including from our faith-based community, nonprofits and community groups and we want to thank all of those who have stepped up to offer support. We have an amazing team, and community members that are doing incredible work under very challenging circumstances, and we appreciate everyone's patience. As the mayor said we're all in this together and it's going to take all of us, standing with each other, helping our neighbours, to get through this. And the most important thing you can do to help your fellow austinites and our first responders, is to stay off the roads, and conserve energy. Every little bit helps. Now to turn into more of the operational issues, I'm going to ask Juan Ortiz with our joint information or joint Emergency Management centre, to provide some details. Juan.<br><br>

5:52<br>
JUAN ORTIZ - EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT CENTRE<br>
Thank you [inaudible] Spencer. First of all, I want to let everybody know that we are not having any impacts to 911 operations. And we're still asking the public to please keep 911 open for immediate emergencies only. We are having some technical difficulties with 811 and the austintexas.gov website which are currently down due to technical and power issues. Currently we have, we have opened up a warming centre, that is open at the Palmer events centre. You can show up at any time. From there, individuals will be routed to additional shelters if necessary, and if [inaudible] conditions permitted to happen safely. We have currently today, as of this morning, we have a, either cold weather shelters remain active throughout the, throughout the day, and as of this morning we have 282 people that were sheltered overnight at the cold weather shelters, and the Palmer events centre. We're asking all residents to stay off the roads. [It helps] first responders, and only drive if they really need to be on the roads, and give themselves plenty of time to get to the destinations. And please drive slowly. The roads are still very treacherous, and you can very easily be fooled with the limited visibility of all the snow and ice that we have on the roads right now, and can get trapped. which them, put first responders, in harm's way as they have to go out and potentially have to rescue you from those situations. So again, we want to ask everybody to please stay off the roads as much as they possibly can. [Inaudible] and other city social and county media channels, we will be using those to make sure that we're relaying as much of the information as we can when we have it, and, and if, and if necessary be able to pass on to you actions that you can take to protect yourselves and your family. We urge residents to, again, reiterate the same message, urging the residents and everybody to conserve as much power as possible, to help with the emergency issues and Austin Energy will follow our remarks to further discuss the rotating outages. We are working with critical facilities like hospitals and other critical places to ensure that the the access to those facilities remain open, to ensure that ambulances are able to access those emergency rooms, ramps, and make sure that those, those locations are completely accessible in the event that we have to transport medical personnel to those locations. If you need... That's the end of my remarks.
<br><br>

9:07<br>
HOST<br>
Thank you very much Juan and before we jump over to Austin energy I see we have judge Brown back so definitely want to give him an opportunity to try again and see if this works.
<br><br>

9:16<br>
JUDGE BROWN<br>
All right, how's this Can you hear me? Okay, awesome. Thanks. Yeah. So as I was saying I'm actually, the power still off at my hous so I'm doing this from my car without really a good internet connection. Um, it's been off since about 2am today so I think that there's a lot of people a lot of us in the same boat here in Austin and Travis County. But I do know that the electric companies and the the providers of energy and the county and the city are doing everything they can to get it back online so that we have power in our house, and just want to echo what everybody else said about definitely stay in your house if at all possible, unless there's some, some kind of emergency because the roads are extremely dangerous. I also want to take a second just to thank all the first responders I was up at the Emergency Operations Centre last night with Juan and Eric and others, until about 1am and the work that they're doing is amazing they were able to connect for, as one example, one subdivision in eastern Travis County that did not have, they run out of propane basically in their subdivision. And through the work of the city, Molly, with the city, was able to get a sand truck to lead a propane truck to fill that back up and so there's really amazing work going on, by our first responders by everyone at the city in the county and the best thing that we can do is, that you can do, is stay home and and not create any additional work for them, frankly, on the roads today, but thank you very much.
<br><br>

10:47<br>
HOST<br>
Thank you Judge, And at this time I will pass it off to Austin Energy General Manager Jacqueline Sargent.
<br><br>

10:58<br>
AUSTIN ENERGY GENERAL MANAGER - JACQUELINE SARGENT<br>
Thank you. As a general manager, I want all of our customers to know how concerned we are about you during this unprecedented weather emergency. As you know this is a statewide event, causing a Texas electric grid emergency and a very urgent call for energy conservation. We know that not having power is extremely frustrating and unnerving, uncomfortable, and we want our customers to know that we're doing everything that we can to work through this ongoing and fluid situation. We strongly urge our customers that still have power to greatly reduce the amount of energy that they are using to help conserve as much as possible. Here are some of the things that you can do to help: Turn down your thermostat. Close your blind. Turn off and unplug devices that are not needed. Every little bit that you can do will help us. Austin Energy is part of the ERCOT [wholesale] market. We work in concert with ERCOT to prepare for energy emergencies. We have plans in place, and we take direction from ERCOT. And the things that we do are helping to strengthen and maintain the Texas grid. With everyone's help, hopefully, we can work together and reduce demand enough so that we can get power back on to our customers. We have scheduled circuits that do not contain critical load. Critical load consists of things like hospitals, control centres, fire stations, water treatment facilities. And so we need to make electricity to those places. And then we have a sequence of circuits that we disconnect, so that we can lower the demand on the system. This event happened quickly, and the amount of load that we needed to remove from the grid was significant, and it was in just a matter of a very short time that we maxed out on all of the available circuits that we have, to disconnect and not interrupt critical load. So because we're at that max limit there's no more energy that we can shut off at this time, so that we can bring these customers back on. And that's why it's so important that we do come together as a community and help each other during this very unprecedented time. Thank you.
<br><br>

13:59<br>
HOST<br>
Thank you everyone so much for those remarks. At this time I'm going to open it up for media questions. I'm going to hand it over to our poll reporter Bridget Spencer with Fox Seven News.<br><br>

14:10<br>
BRIDGET SPENCER - FOX7 NEWS<br>
Good afternoon. Thanks for having me. First question in here is from [KUT]. How can people without power get to a warming centre if everyone is being asked to stay off the roads? Any recommendations for those people without power?
<br><br>

14:31<br>
MAYOR STEVE ADLER<br>
Yes, that's a really good question. And that's why it's important that if you need to get to a warming centre, make the decision now get out and go to the Palmer Event  centre while there's still daylight. And if you need to be on the road, [always available] will help you get there in a safe manner. If you wait. It's going to just get more complicated in the, in the dark, and put you at risk. And that's why we're saying, you know, to stay off the roads, unless you really have to and getting into the Palmer Event Centre because you need to stay warm. That's the, obviously that's something that, that is necessary, but if you need to do so go ahead and come on now, while there's still plenty of daylight.
<br><br>

15:23<br>
BRIDGET SPENCER - FOX7 NEWS<br>
Thank you. Next question is from the Austin Chronicle. What's being done to make sure unhoused people have shelter or admissions into [pro lodges] being accelerated or are there other options being considered?
<br><br>

15:36<br>
MAYOR STEVE ADLER<br>
The city has an existing all-weather shelter plan that has been in existence for, for many, many years. And it's a collaboration between the city the county and the counties of organisations that on a daily basis work to ensure that we have services for those persons that are experiencing homelessness. This plan, traditionally is centred to provide services overnight shelterin. Because of this unique situation, a decision was made several days ago to extend the programme, and provide the service 24 hours a day, and to ensure that we are providing providing those services, adhering to the social distancing requirements that we're living in during this COVID-19 pandemic our entire world is suffering, obviously that introduces some challenges to the process. So we're having to ensure that we evaluate the proper capacity and assess it to meet those COVID-19 requirements and has required us to open up additional facilities to ensure that we have plenty of space to meet the need. Like I indicated before, overnight we were able to support 282 individuals that came in, and were processed. We still have space remaining, and we're opening up additional space. And we're recording that we're turning [inaudible] through the event centre facility that we have there, and we're working with countless organisations to expand those capacities to ensure that anybody that needs a place to come in and stay warm, they has, they have a place, and we're working with capital Metro to see what can be done to ensure that we have the ability to move those, those persons that need to stay warm in the proper locations, even though that they're having challenges, right now, with limited services due to the current weather conditions that we're experiencing. Hi Juan, is that number 512-305 ICEE operating and active? For information about warming and cold weather shelters?
<br><br>
18:02<br>
JUAN ORTIZ - EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT CENTRE<br>
Yes, Mayor that number is, should be up and running, and we have, we're working with our, the Austin Travis County EMF services to make sure that we're [reporting] with all of the members that are of the organisations that are, that traditionally work with persons that are experiencing homelessness.
<br><br>
18:30<br>
Thank you, from CBS Austin, what percentage of Austin energy outages are caused by Urquhart and what are other local problems. And when do you expect to have these issues resolved this morning, or cloud said outages are being caused by local generation or generation, transmission owners, having problems keeping up with and lowering demand overwhelming systems.
<br><br>
18:57<br>
AUSTIN ENERGY GENERAL MANAGER - JACQUELINE SARGENT<br>
So, we have, this is Jackie Sargent again with Austin Energy. We have some situations where we've had some outages. And we are including that in our load shed requirements so right now that is all, all wrapped together to meet those obligations that we have for the rotating outages that are caught has directed us to do. We are standing ready, our crews are prepared. We are working on infrastructure. And we are working to do that safely in these very extreme conditions. Our folks have been working around the clock. I can't break out a percentage of any specific load that I can identify to a, a non event outage at this time. But we are aware of where our system is at. And we are operating within the constraints, and the direction of ERCOT. ERCOT has said that based on what they are looking at that this situation is likely to continue through the night, and possibly into the afternoon, tomorrow. So it depends on what we do as consumers in managing our load our consumption of electricity and the more that we can do to conserve the more we can help our neighbours. And then, also, making sure that our resources are operating appropriately and Austin energy has staffing 24/7. We have people that are staying in our facilities to make sure that we can continue to operate. And we are doing everything possible to help manage this situation.
<br><br>
20:58<br>
BRIDGET SPENCER - FOX7 NEWS<br>
OK thank you. Next question's from The Statesman. How many exposure related calls of Austin first responders gotten and can you give some examples? Have any exposure related deaths been recorded as well?
<br><br>
21:11<br>
JUAN ORTIZ - EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT CENTRE<br>
I don't have that information at this point in time, but I can ask the Austin Travis County EMS to provide that information after this call.
<br><br>
21:24<br>
BRIDGET SPENCER - FOX7 NEWS<br>
Thank you. Next question. KView. What is Austin Energy's goal for having power restored to all? Is it too early to predict?
<br><br>
21:35<br>
AUSTIN ENERGY GENERAL MANAGER - JACQUELINE SARGENT<br>
I would say right now, it's too early to predict, and that we are in this event, it is a statewide event. And we are currently operating under direction from ERCOT, the grid operator. And so we will have to follow those directions and we're waiting for that direction from ERCOT to be able to restore power to our customers. As I said previously, ERCOT is saying that the situation, could continue through the evening and possibly into tomorrow afternoon.
<br><br>
22:18<br>
Okay. Thank you. Next question is from Austin Monitor. Was there a plan to deal with loss of power over [311] and the city website? How do you intend to deal with this situation in the future?
<br><br>
22:36<br>
Could you repeat that question.
<br><br>
22:39<br>
Sure. Was there a plan to deal with loss of power for 311 and the city's website. how do you deal with that.
<br><br>
22:56<br>
AUSTIN ENERGY GENERAL MANAGER - JACQUELINE SARGENT<br>
Oh 311 is being impacted by, not by a loss of power, but by some technology challenges that, that are happening. We are working with our utility contact centre to backup that resource. And we will continue to see what can be done to mitigate that we are working in conjunction with the city's IT folks, and they are working very diligently to restore those services, both the web services, and the 311 centre, contact centre. Juan, I don't know if you have anything that you can add to that for us.
<br><br>
23:50<br>
JUAN ORTIZ - EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT CENTRE<br>
After every disaster that our community experiences we actually go through a very rigorous action review process and identify ways that we can prevent these types of impacts from happening. Once this event is over we will be conducting a, an after action in identifying protective actions that we will be engaging with the different departments in the city and the county to ensure that though, anything that we can do to strengthen and make our community more resilient, we will, tose are addressed. Again, this is a, you know, unprecedented event that that we have not experienced in, in probably 30 or 40 years and so there's some things that were not in, that didn't exist back in the early 1980s when we had an event similar to this, that, that, now do exist. And so there are some things that we're going to learn, and we are committed to ensuring that we identify those and make sure that we set the right teams to address them and complete those corrective actions.
<br><br>
25:04<br>
BRIDGET SPENCER - FOX7 NEWS<br>
Thank you very much. [Inaudible] have the next question. Is there any indication that energy customers are heeding the call to preserve, conserve power?
<br><br>
25:20<br>
AUSTIN ENERGY GENERAL MANAGER - JACQUELINE SARGENT<br>
We are making those requests. We have reached out to specific groups of customers and they are responding by conserving, and the things that I talked about earlier, that individuals can do such as lowering your thermostats and closing your blinds and unplugging devices that are not currently being used, will help us. We cannot measure each individual's contributions at that small scale but collectively it will help us to better manage the current situation.
<br><br>
26:02<br>
BRIDGET SPENCER - FOX7 NEWS<br>
The next question is from us here at Fox7. It appears that South Austin seems to be bearing the brunt of the blackouts. Is that the case and if so, why is that?
<br><br>
26:18<br>
AUSTIN ENERGY GENERAL MANAGER - JACQUELINE SARGENT<br>
That is not the case. The outages are across the system. And they are designated by specific circuits. And those circuits. If we look at the outage map are across across our service territory.
<br><br>
26:41<br>
JUDGE BROWN<br>
So for whatever it's worth I'm in Hyde Park and my power's been off since 2:00 so, and I think the whole, the part of, it's everything sort of west of Duvall as best I can tell, in that area has been out, up until I think over to like Lamar or something.
<br><br>
27:09<br>
BRIDGET SPENCER - FOX7 NEWS<br>
Sorry. Did I interrupt you. Go ahead.
<br><br>
27:12<br>
AUSTIN ENERGY GENERAL MANAGER - JACQUELINE SARGENT<br>
I was just going to add that those are that are part of the circuits that we were instructed by ERCOT, to turn off as part of response to this event. And as we add all those circuits we got to the point where we hit all of them so we couldn't drop, we couldn't drop additional load to enter, go back and start picking up and rotating through, so we got to that maximum point and and there's, and we're basically we're stuck here until we can get some reprieve from ERCOT, and can start releasing some of those circuits and and work into rotating those outages. So it's a tough situation. We understand that. We're doing everything we can to get people, get, to get to a place where we can get people's power back on.
<br><br>
28:13<br>
BRIDGET SPENCER - FOX7 NEWS<br>
Thank you. Next question is from Community [inaudible]. With more cold temperatures and precipitation in the forecast later this week is there a chance once power is restored, it will have to be reduced again, and what steps are being taken to improve events in the future?
<br><br>
28:34<br>
AUSTIN ENERGY GENERAL MANAGER - JACQUELINE SARGENT<br>
That is a, a possible outcome that could occur. There are a number of things. If, you know, we see this continuously across the entire footprint of the, the ERCOT grid across our state, then it is likely that we'll continue to have challenges to be able to meet the demand. And so, asking customers to conserve is something that's going to be and continue to be very critical. With additional weather events, especially moisture in these freezing temperatures, we get buildup of ice on on vegetation, you know, trees, on power lines, on equipment that we have, and that causes, in the case of trees, branches to break off, either come in contact with power lines, actually in some cases pull those power lines down and create outages in areas. And some of those areas are very challenging to get to, we saw that in our, the Northwest area of our service territory where we have canyons, and we have a great deal of vegetation, and we had to get crews into both locations and with the icy conditions that makes it very challenging. And for people working, you know tirelessly around the clock to be out in those elements and get that power restored. But our folks are ready to do that. They're committed to doing that. And they like to see the lights on. And we want to do that for our customers. So I would say continue to watch, and monitor these conditions. Do what you can to to be prepared and have those resources that you need available, because we cannot say for sure this won't continue to go on and continue to happen. It is going to be very dependent on what happens within the state within ERCOT and then [inaudible] this territory here in Austin.<br><br>
30:52<br>
running water because of this storm, how many and what is the city or county going to help.
<br><br>
31:02<br>
MAYOR STEVE ADLER<br>
My understanding from the water department is that they have had a few water main breaks, but nothing that has resulted in any major loss of water. My understanding is that all of those are being addressed in a timely manner, but I will, after the call will get you more detailed information on that.
<br><br>
31:29<br>
BRIDGET SPENCER - FOX7 NEWS<br>

And so looks like the last question from and where are they located.
<br><br>
31:38<br>
MAYOR STEVE ADLER<br>
I'm sorry. Can you repeat the question,
<br><br>
31:41<br>
BRIDGET SPENCER - FOX7 NEWS<br>
how many shelters does the city currently have and where are they located.
<br><br>
31:46<br>
MAYOR STEVE ADLER<br>

We're currently are have, 4 cold weather shelters that are that are open and are running. And plus, a warming centre that is also functioning as a shelter. We are coordinating, we're distributing the persons that need to be sheltered to different shelters, through the Palmer Event Centre. So for that reason we're not disclosing the locations of all of the shelters, but we're using facilities we've used in the past, and in a manner that allows us to make sure that we have a control of how the people are coming in and make sure that we have the adequate level of resources in each location. There is also, what I can say is that they're spread out throughout throughout the city. We're also looking at other, three additional potential locations, excuse me, actually four additional potential locations and they have different varying capacity, but we feel that by the end of today, we will have approximately 450 spaces available, and which is, you know, doubling or more what our current occupancy is, and we'll be gauging that and we'll be expanding and opening up additional centres, if that is required. Also, along those lines, what were some of the things to kind of gauge what the need is in the community. Last night we put together a task force between the city and the county and mobilised the task force consisting of Austin police often fire in Austin, county EMS and the Austin Parks and Recs department. The public officials went up to 45 encampments and offered rides to all weather shelters, you know, to the people experiencing homelessness and anybody else that we, that they encountered, and to ensure that they were aware and made sure that transportation was not going to be an issue, and also operations continued all the way till about six this morning. We'll be looking at, re-evaluating that and making sure that we, that if necessary engage those activities.
<br><br>
34:17<br>
HOST<br>
Thank you very much. [Inaudible] turn it back over to do we still have Judge, Judge Brown if you're still on I'll turn it back over to you for some closing comments.<br><br>
34:31<br>
JUDGE BROWN<br>
Thanks. Yeah, I don't know if my video is working but I think just want to thank everybody especially all the first responders for their work. And also I believe that there's, we may be asking people tomorrow morning, if they do have power, and if they are trying to go, you know, to work or take a shower in the morning. I believe that there's some requests that maybe people take showers tonight so that we aren't all using hot water and gas first thing in the morning tomorrow so if there's a way to accommodate for that and not, you know, at the first thing, crack of dawn tomorrow, I think about the hours from maybe 7:00 to 10am, not overload the usage of gas is something, a message that I had received as well. But overall, I wanna thank Juan, and Eric and everybody at the emergency operation Centre for all their work for these past few days.<br><br>
35:34<br>
MAYOR STEVE ADLER<br>
Thank you, Judge, I want to join in the judge in thanking the first responders all the volunteers, and also all the community groups that are engaged at this point. This is truly and absolutely unprecedented, a perfect storm, and we're all in this together, we're going to have to hang together. Know that there are 2 million people across the state of Texas dealing with this, this very same thing, folks are working really hard to try and get power back on, but it could be a while. You know, there's a phone number to call if you're looking for a warmer place to be 512-305. ICEE,. [Inaudible] The best place you can be is to stay in your house [inauduble]. If you can't, and you have to go out, try that number, and then go to the [inaudible] centre [inaudible] place to go and if not it's a better place to be [inaudible], to a better place. Know that there are a lot of people in the community that are helping I'll just repeat again, AAUL That's Austi Area Urban League .org AAUL.org Love Thy Neighbour Texas campaign accepting monetary donations for things like hotel vouchers. If you want to donate a warm blanket [inaudible] is accepting those at their downtown location or you can even order a blanket on it and have it shipped to them directly. The food bank is closed today but if you're in need of food. dial 211 or 211texas.org This is one of those times [inaudible] not just the government, it's all the charitable and service organisations, it's everybody calling their neighbours, especially if they're elderly. We're all in this together and we're gonna take it one moment at a time. Be safe.

<br><br>
37:40<br>
HOST<br>
Thank you very much. This concludes our media briefing on the cold weather events that have impacted our city. We remind everyone to. I'm sorry, I just got a message. City manager Spencer Kronk, I believe you had some closing comments as well.
<br><br>
37:58<br>
AUSTIN CITY MANAGER - SPENCER KRONK<br>
Sure. Just want to really appreciate it again everyone in our community that's leaning in to not only ensure that they are keeping themselves and their families safe, but keeping their neighbours safe. As we know this is impacting every corner of our state, but it's also impacting the corners of our neighbourhood and the corners of our homes and so the more that we can look to our neighbour, and find out what assistance we can be providing them, the better off we're going to be, collectively. So thank you to everyone that's really leaning into this and ensuring that we're all in this together. I also want to be the first responders and all the city employees, the county employees that are really working around the clock to keep us safe. It's a once in a generation event, and we will get through it, and we will get through it together. Thank you.
<br><br>
38:50<br>
HOST<br>
Thank you very much. Again everyone, this actually does not conclude our media briefing. Again we remind everyone can continue to follow city and county social media channels for further updates and changing information. Thank you again everybody.
