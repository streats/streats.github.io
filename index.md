Iâ€™m Annie, a user-centered designer focused on content, research and accessibility. 

This website hosts my [resume](resume.md), [writing portfolio](/work/index.md), [case studies](/case-studies/index.md), and [miscellaneous notes about craft](/craft-notes/index.md). 

## Accessibility
This site has been optimized for accessibility. To learn more, read my [Accessibility Statement](accessibility-statement.md).

## Acknowledgements
Many thanks to [Nicolas Vanhoren](https://github.com/nicolas-van) for their [Easy Markdown to Github Pages](https://nicolas-van.github.io/easy-markdown-to-github-pages/) article which helped me set up a simple, responsive, accessible static site in just a few minutes.
