# Welcome
Iâ€™m Annie, a user-centered designer, focused on content, research and accessibility. 

This website hosts my [resume](resume.md), [writing portfolio](/work/index.md), [case studies](/case-studies/index.md), and [miscellaneous publishings](misc.md). 

This site has been optimized for accessibility. To learn more, read my Accessibility Statement.  

## Contact me
I'm [@streats_ on Twitter](https://twitter.com/streats_), though I rarely use it.
You can also [file an issue on my GitHub](https://github.com/streats/streats.github.io/issues) with feedback, suggestions, or bugs.

## Acknowledgements
Many thanks to [Nicolas Vanhoren](https://github.com/nicolas-van) for their [Easy Markdown to Github Pages](https://nicolas-van.github.io/easy-markdown-to-github-pages/) article which helped me set up a simple, responsive, accessible static site in just a few minutes.
