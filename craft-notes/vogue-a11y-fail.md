title: 'A11y fail: Vogue article about accessibility has images with ineffective alt text'
---

An [article on Vogue Business about improvements in accessibility in the beauty industry](https://www.voguebusiness.com/beauty/beauty-fails-people-with-disabilities-loreal-estee-lauder-unilever-wants-to-change-that) includes some charts and graphs which have alt descriptions which do not effectively describe the image. 

For example, this image of a chart: 

![A chart titled "Percentage of US households with a member who identifies with a disability", showing that 20% identify with "Physical limitations", 8% "Vision difficulty", 7% "Hearing difficulty", 6% "Independent living difficulty", 6% "Learning difficulty", "3% Intellectual disability". n = 46, 874 respondents. Survey taken between March - April 2016. Data source: Nielsen's reaching prevalent, diverse consumers with disabilities report, 2016. ](https://media.voguebusiness.com/photos/60db48dbb3326e449dab62fb/master/w_1600,c_limit/chart-inline-21-story-inline-1.jpg)

However the alt text for this image says "Image may contain Text Plot Number and Symbol", and the body text of the page does not explain the chart content. 

In addition, these images cannot easily be viewed in full size (user has to know how to open image in a new tab, for example, or download/save the image)
